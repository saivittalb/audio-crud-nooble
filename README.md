A simple backend repo for creating and maintaining an audio shorts directory. APIs were built to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) Audio Short and List Audio Shorts. Done as a part of my intro assignment for interning with Nooble.

The tech stack used was Go and PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL was utilized using the cloud-based setup with the help of ElephantSQL.
